# 👨‍💻 C# TRAINING CAMP PRACTICAL PROJECTS

Below are the projects and contents related to the C# Training Camp.

---

### 📍 **PROJECT 1: FIRST STEP - CONSOLE APPLICATION**
In this project, I learned how to print messages to the console. By using the Console.WriteLine() command, I repeated basic output operations and explored the building blocks of a C# program. 🌍

---

### 📍 **PROJECT 2: DATA TYPES AND VARIABLES**
In this project, I learned about basic data types such as int, string, double, and how to create variables in these types. I strengthened my understanding by performing various operations and experiments on different data types. 🔢

---

### 📍 **PROJECT 3: ARRAYS AND COLLECTIONS**
By working with arrays and lists, I learned methods for storing data together. I deepened my knowledge by experimenting with various array-related scenarios.  🧩

---

### 📍 **PROJECT 4: CONDITIONAL STRUCTURES (IF-ELSE)**
In this project, I explored decision-making structures using if-else. By continuously testing different conditions, I learned how the program behaves under different scenarios.  ⚖️

---

### 📍 **PROJECT 5: LOOPS FOR REPEATING OPERATIONS**
I learned how to automate repetitive operations using For, while, and foreach loops. I deepened my understanding of how loops work by using various loop structures multiple times. 🔄

---

### 📍 **PROJECT 6: STRUCTURAL PROGRAMMING WITH METHODS**
In this project, I created methods to make my code more organized. By creating methods for repeated code blocks, I reduced repetition and wrote cleaner code. 🛠️

---

### 📍 **PROJECT 7: CALCULATING EXAM GRADES WITH FOREACH**
In this project, I developed a system to calculate students' exam grades using the foreach loop. By repeatedly calculating grades and averages, I built a solid system. 🎓

---

### 📍 **PROJECT 8: FUNCTIONS WITH RETURNING VALUES**
In this project, I processed user data using functions that return values. I enhanced my functional programming skills by repeatedly testing these functions. 🎗️

---

### 📍 **PROJECT 9: DATABASE-BASED PRODUCT-CATEGORY INFORMATION SYSTEM**
In this project, I learned how to retrieve data from the TblCategory table in SQL Server using ADO.NET. I asked the user which table they wanted to view, and then displayed data from the database based on their selection.  🌐

---

### 📍 **PROJECT 10: DATABASE MANAGEMENT WITH CRUD OPERATIONS**
In this project, I developed a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) system using SQL Server and ADO.NET. Using SQL Connection and SQL Command classes, I connected to the database. I added user input to SQL queries using the AddWithValue method to reduce the risk of SQL injection and created a more secure structure. During the data listing process, I used SqlDataAdapter and DataTable to manage the data more effectively. Through this process, I reinforced my understanding of CRUD operations and gained hands-on experience. 🛠️
